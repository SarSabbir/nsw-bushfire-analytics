# NSW Bushfire Analytics

### 🔥 Project Summary
This repository replicates and extends Visner et al. (2021), *Buildings 11(37)* — “Spatial Analysis, Interactive Visualisation and GIS-Based Dashboard for Monitoring Spatio-Temporal Changes of Bushfires in NSW, Australia.”  
The replication uses **NASA FIRMS (MODIS)** fire detections for 2024, runs statistical trend analysis (GLM, Kendall τ) in Python, and produces daily fire trend visualisations.  
All code is executable directly in **GitHub Codespaces** for full reproducibility.
